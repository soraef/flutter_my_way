# flutter_my_way
This repository was created for the purpose of packaging patterns that I often use in my flutter projects.

## dart_result
Package to provide Result type

## firebase_repository
Implementation of Repository pattern to CRUD Firebase and map it to its own Entity class
Using mixin, you can customize the repository, such as a repository that only allows Get or a repository that allows full CRUD.
